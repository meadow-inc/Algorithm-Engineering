# Hello and Welcome!

These are structured approaches to design and implement various algorithms, with a focus on performance.
While the first two projects were written in Java, Projects 4 and 5 were written in Rust. 

On projects 1,2,4,5 I worked together with another student (name stated on every paper of the appropriate report).

In the final Exam (ExamWiese) I implemented the code and wrote the paper alone.
While an evaluation is given on every Exercise, there is no evaluation file for my Exam. The Exam was graded 1.3 (1.0 highest grade, 5.0 not passed).

Please read the README.md in the corresponding solution folder!
